When writing modular code in R and splitting up different tasks into functions do you store the functions as stand-alone R scripts in your working directory (e.g. myFun1.R, myFun2.R etc.) and then source the function scripts into your main script? Or would you recommend writing several functions - specific for just that project - in one script (e.g. allFun.R) and then only source that one? Or do you usually define functions within the main script along with the other code? My guess is that a mix of these strategies should be used; if so what are your general guidelines for what situations / function types are most suitable for each strategy?
